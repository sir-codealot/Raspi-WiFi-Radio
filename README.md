# Raspi-WiFi-Radio

Here you can find some Python (3) scripts which turn your Raspberry Pi into a internet radio.

It is designed to work with some buttons (using gpiozero library)
and an OLED display with 128x64 / 128x32 resolution. 
To have it work Adafruit Library (128x32) and BLavery's lib_oled96 library is used.
Thanks for them at this point.
